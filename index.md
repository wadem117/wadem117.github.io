## About

I have worked as a student worker with the [Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics), animal research intern at [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://www.lpzoo.org), and student researcher with [Dr. Jalene LaMontagne's lab](http://lamontagnelab.weebly.com/) at DePaul University. 

I am currently a MS candidate within the Vanderbilt University Data Science Institute. I have a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from DePaul University. My accomplishments at DePaul include completion of the University Honor's Program, being awarded a Dean's Undergraduate Research Fellowship, and completion of the Undergaduate Internship Program with the College of Science and Health. 

I have completed several analyses and projects using sports data, most commonly from the National Hockey League. For the past few years, I have been fortunate enough to provide statistical support for the NCAA and Southeastern Collegiate Ice Hockey Conference (SECHC). 

My research experience includes heavy utilization of statistical analyses and data visualization. I am skilled in the use of R, Python, SQL, and Tableau.

In my free time, I am an avid hockey player, cyclist, cook, and coffee drinker. 

Feel free to peruse some of my works below! 

## Projects 

### Ecological effects on national happiness (2019)
National happiness is an important characteristic for governments and NGOs as increased international mobility allows for more individual choice in country of residence. Improving culturally broad elements of national happiness, however, is difficult. Here, we seek to understand the specific relationships between ecological impact and happiness at the national level. National happiness was shown to increase with carbon footprint, though this relationship was strongly driven by gross domestic product (GDP). Countries with weaker economies experience a steeper rise in national happiness with increases in carbon footprint, suggesting that investing in industrial economies in these countries can result in improved national happiness.

### Spatial patterns of white spruce in Eastern North America (2017)
Many species are responding to climate change by adjusting their spatial distribution and altering their growth patterns, especially near range limits. We studied historic growth of white spruce over two spatial scales. We studied populations in Michigan, Ontario, and New Brunswick to examine growth trends over distances of >1500 km, and then local populations separated by a distance of 5 km in Michigan. Trends in growth were compared to mean temperatures across sites. We demonstrate the use of regional climate, influenced at local scales by topographical features (e.g. presence of large water bodies), to study the effects of climate change.

### Modeling stereotypic behaviors in African Wild Dogs (2016)
African Wild Dogs (*Lycaon pictus*) are a highly social, endangered canid species native to central and eastern Africa. For individuals in captivity, behavioral variation is an important consideration for welfare standards, and may be influenced by a number of factors, such as temperature, sound levels, crowd size, and weather. We collected several environmental readings and studied behavior of two African Wild Dogs at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analysis was used to determine which combinations of explanatory variables best explained the observed variation in behavioral richness. Ambient temperature alone was shown to have the greatest probability of explaining behavioral variation, but not at a substantially higher likelihood than the other models. Behavioral richness was shown to vary significantly at different times of the day, suggesting behavior is influenced by daily schedule.

### Comparing changes in salinity with plankton community composition (2016)
The biodiversity of an aquatic community is often representative of its relationship with abiotic factors of the environment, including water salinity and temperature. Transitional zone plankton communities are especially indicative, as they respond quickly to changes in environmental conditions. To study how changes in salinity in an estuarine ecosystem affect the plankton communities that live there, plankton samples were collected from a single site in Mosquito Creek, a tidal waterway in A.C.E Basin, South Carolina, in December, 2015. Samples were taken every hour from high to low tide, allowing for observation through one tidal cycle. The salinity and temperature of the water were recorded at each time increment. Using species richness, the diversity of the plankton community was shown to be directly and significantly related to the salinity of the water. It was determined that variation in species identification among researchers was a limiting factor, but our methods were such that it likely did not significantly affect the accuracy of our findings.
